# UX Comeback – 21 Days 🙃

Yep, I ghosted UX for a month.  
Now I’ve decided to panic-learn a whole course in 21 days 🍜  

This repo is where I’ll document my slow crawl from admin → UX designer → maybe digital nomad someday 🌍  

## What to Expect
- Daily/weekly updates (if I actually do them) 📅  
- Projects, sketches, and prototypes (no magic, just sweat) ⚡  
- Lessons learned & productivity hacks (how not to rot in bed) 🕶️  
- Networking with fellow aspiring designers (because misery loves company)  

Follow along if you want to watch someone survive a UX speedrun 😏
